Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Our slope is not zero just be looking at the p-value, which is less than 0.05.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Our R-squared value is 71%, which means roughly ~71% of the time the model our model will most likely predict MPG values correctly. Some of the Factors that might contribute some of this variability might be ground clearance and vehicle length. There might be other factors that may contribute to the variability that perhaps were not capture in our data
