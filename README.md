Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Our slope is not zero just be looking at the p-value, which is less than 0.05.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Our R-squared value is 67%, which means roughly ~67% of the time the model our model will most likely predict MPG values correctly. Some of the Factors that might contribute some of this variability might be ground clearance and vehicle length. There might be other factors that may contribute to the variability that perhaps were not capture in our data

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

Lot 1 and Lot 2 are both within design specifications. Lot 3 shows the most variance and exceeds the manufacturers specs.
